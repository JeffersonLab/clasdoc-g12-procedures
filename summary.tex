\section{Summary of Running Conditions}

The \desg{g12} experiment contained several analyses where the main goal was to search for resonances in the multi-particle final state by performing partial wave analysis. These analyses\cite{clas.thesis.bookwalter, clas.thesis.schott} do not require absolute normalization and therefore several steps discussed below were skipped. For a general discussion of the PWA procedure by \desg{g12} Ref.~\cite{pwa.salgado2014}. We do however provide details for analyses that do want this normalization for cross sections and upper limits later in this document.

The \desg{g12} experiment was a high-luminosity, high-energy real-photon run for \abbr{CLAS}. The electron beam current was 60--65~nA on the 40~cm $\ell$H$_2$ target. A total of $26\times 10^8$ triggers were recorded using several of the 12 available trigger bits. The ``production trigger'' required two prongs (start-counter and time-of-flight coincidence) in two different sectors and in coincidence with a tagger hit at or above 3.6~GeV. There was secondary trigger which required three prongs, again in different sectors, regardless of tagger hits. The running conditions are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:runconditions}. There were three proposals associated with this experiment which are listed here:
