\subsection{\label{sec:calib.tag}Tagger Timing Calibration}
The timing calibration of the tagger system was performed using the standard procedures. Overall, the quality of the calibration is excellent, showing an overall timing resolution of about $130~ps$, when the tagger time is compared with the RF time. The counter-by-counter alignment can be seen on Fig.~\ref{tagtpho}. The calibration was checked on a run by run basis (Fig.~\ref{tagRun}), and new constants were commissioned when major changes were noticed.

  \caption{And example of the tagger timing calibration and the T-counter alignment, comparing  the difference between photon time determined from the tagger elements (T-counters, in this particular plot), and photon timing according to the RF. The relative intensity of the paddles shown are due to the trigger configuration, see Tables.~\ref{tab:data.trig.conf.2} and \ref{tab:data.trig.mor}.}
