\subsection{\label{sec:calib.dc}Drift Chamber Calibration and Resolution}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:DC.TOF.res}Drift Chamber and TOF smearing parameters in \prog{gpp}}

Tracking in the Drift Chamber of a \abbr{CLAS} Sector is performed using the six superlayers of the \abbr{DC}. A good measure of the the quality of tracking are the \abbr{DC} residuals for each superlayer. After a track is identified using the hit elements in the \abbr{DC} superlayer, It's \abbr{DC} residual is calculated using the TBLA bank as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
fabs(TBLA->tbla[i].fitdoca) - fabs(TBLA->tbla[i].calcdoca)
\end{verbatim}

The values of the DC residuals in the CLAS data are empirically found to be a good fit to a convolution of 2 gaussians - a narrow gaussian and a broad gaussian. During DC calibrations efforts were made to minimize this residual to have maximum reconstruction efficiency. The mean and width of the residuals as a function of superlayer and run number are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:calib.dc.residuals.mean} and \ref{fig:calib.dc.residuals.wid} respectively.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:calib.dc.eff}Drift Chamber Wire Efficiency}
To generate the wiretap for g12, the utility pdu, available in SVN, was used. Maurizio Ungaro made the wiremaps for g12 with the root files [A01 and A02] for each run. These output files are at \url{/home/mukesh/work/pdu_hbook} at Jlab. Root files needed are at \url{/home/mukesh/work/pdu_root}. The values were added to the g12 database. The results of the wiretap are plotted in for each sector:
