\subsection{\label{sec:calib.st}Start Counter Performance}

The start counter was calibrated 

At this stage, the momenta ($p$) of the tracks are taken as given by the drift chamber and tracking algorithm as found in the \bank{TBTR} bank, and the energy ($\Epid$) of the particle is set when the mass is assigned. This allows us to calculate the speed of the particle:
\begin{equation}
    \betapid = \frac{p}{\Epid}.
    \label{eqn:betapid}
\end{equation}
This is used to calculate the vertex time of the particle:
\begin{equation}
    \tvtofpid = \ttof - \frac{\ltof}{c\betapid},
    \label{eqn:tvtofpid}
\end{equation}
where $\ttof$ and $\ltof$ are the time and path length of the track at the \system{TOF} plane as obtained from the \bank{TDPL} bank, both adjusted to the intersection point of the two kaons. This time is converted a ``photon time'' ($\tpho$) by subtracting the photon propagation time ($\tprop$) from the center of the target:
\begin{equation}
    \tphotofpid = \tvtofpid - \tprop,
    \label{eqn:tphotofpid}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \tprop = \frac{1}{c} \left( \ztgt - \zv \right),
\end{equation}
where $\ztgt$ is the center of the target's z-position ($-90$~cm in the \system{CLAS} coordinate system), and $\zv$ is the z-coordinate of the track's vertex position -- in this case, the intersection of the two kaons where the covariance matrixes of the estimated momenta are taken into account through the standard \prog{MVRT} vertexing algorithm. This photon time, $\tphotofpid$, is compared to the \system{RF}-corrected tagger times ($\ttgrf$) of each hit in the photon tagger as obtained from the \bank{TAGR} bank.
