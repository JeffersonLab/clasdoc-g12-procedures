\begin{abstract}
This document serves to summarize all information needed to process and analyze data from the \abbr{CLAS} \desg{g12} experiment taken in the summer of 2008. This was a high-luminosity, high-energy real-photon run with a 65~nA circularly polarized beam, 40~cm unpolarized $\ell$H$_2$ target and an $\ebeam$ up to 5.7~GeV. The associated proposals, and therefore the trigger, focused on the high-energy part of the tagger, and though it was not part of the original proposals, the Cherenkov was active for most of the run.
