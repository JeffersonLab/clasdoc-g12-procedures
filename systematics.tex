\section{\label{sec:resonances}Comparison of Data to Known Resonances}

In this section we show a series of figures depicting known resonances with the \abbr{g12} data. The reader is encouraged to compare the masses and widths measured with the PDG\cite{pdg}.

\section{\label{sec:xsec}Comparison of Data to Known Cross Sections}

Figures~\ref{fig:xsec.omega1} and \ref{fig:xsec.omega2} show the differential cross sections for the reaction: γ p $\rightarrow$ p ω, based on the dominant decay mode: ω $\rightarrow$ π$^+$ π$^-$ π$^0$. For this analysis, we have selected events with two positively-charged tracks for the proton and the π$^+$ as well as one negatively-charged track for the π$^-$. The selection has used runs 56520 - 56572, 56573 - 56594, and 56608 - 56646 (Table 2), which were {\it event-sorted} according to {\bf 2-2pos1neg\_not\_1ckaon1ctrk} (Section~3.2). The analyzed run ranges comprise all g12-events that require in the trigger at least three charged tracks in three different sectors but were not subjected to {\it pre-scaling} to enhance events with high photon energies. This removed an additional layer of complication for studying normalization issues.

We have applied the standard {\sc eloss} corrections but tuned momentum corrections to the proper shape of the pull distributions in the kinematic fitting of the reaction: γ p $\rightarrow$ p π$^+$ π$^-$ (no missing particle). A certain ambiguity was observed when we tried to apply g12 photon-energy corrections; similar results could be achieved by shifting these corrections to the momentum of the final state. At the end, we decided not to apply photon-energy corrections in line with our analyses of other CLAS run-group data. After all initial kinematic corrections, the three-track events were then subject to 1C kinematic fitting imposing energy and momentum conservation as well as requiring a missing π$^0$ in the reaction; events have then been selected with a confidence-level (CL) cut of 0.001 which essentially only demands fit convergence. In the final step, ω $\rightarrow$ π$^+$ π$^-$ π$^0$ events were identified in the invariant π$^+$ π$^-$ π$^0$ mass. The signal and background separation was achieved by applying the Q-value method which assigns a quality factor to each event indicating the likelihood for the event to be signal. The high efficiency of this method justifies the relatively small CL cut. At this point, we have not yet applied the fiducial cuts discussed in this note. However, we do not expect any significant impact on our final results.

For the differential cross sections, the ω yields have been determined for 50-MeV wide energy bins and 20 bins in the corresponding angular distributions (of the ω in the overall center-of-mass system). Shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:xsec.omega1} and \ref{fig:xsec.omega2} is the energy range 1.50 - 3.80 GeV. We will discuss the full energy range in the upcoming analysis note on our particular work. The angular distributions of the ω production were acceptance corrected by studying the reaction in GEANT-based simulations. These acceptance corrections include a simulation of the geometrical trigger configuration requiring three different tracks in three different sectors. The remaining overall normalization consists of contributions from the photon flux using {\sc gflux} and further corrections to account for trigger inefficiencies. The latter originate dominantly from start-counter inefficiencies and were estimated to be 6\,\%. In addition, a beam-current dependent correction was applied of (16 / 60)\% = 0.27\% per nA. This is consistent with other g12-analyses. We have compared normalized and acceptance-corrected ω yields from the production runs (at 60 nA) as well as single-sector runs (at 24 nA) and observed a near perfect agreement over the full run range used in this analysis. From this we conclude that the current and trigger corrections are under control. Finally, we studied background stemming from accidental photons. An overall very small contribution was observed by studying the ω yields from timing side bins. For the photon selection, we applied a {\sc ngrf}=1 cut which removed about 10-15\,\% of all events showing multiple photons.
