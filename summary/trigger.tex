\subsection{\label{sec:summary.trigger}Trigger Configurations}

The \desg{g12} experiment was the first Hall \desg{B} run-period to implement field programmable gate array (\abbr{FPGA}) processors to handle the trigger logic of the \abbr{abbr{CLAS}} detector (see Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.daq}). With this new \abbr{FPGA}-powered triggering system, came the ability to modify the trigger quickly during the experiment. While potentially dangerous --- these changes must be accounted for in total-cross-sectional analyses for example --- this allowed the group to tune the trigger to get the highest possible rate of physical events.

The trigger bits used during the \desg{g12} running period are defined in Tables~\ref{tab:data.trig.conf.1}, \ref{tab:data.trig.conf.2} and \ref{tab:data.trig.conf.3}. They generally consisted of a number of tracks which were the coincidence of any one of the four start counter paddles and any of the 57 time-of-flight paddles in a given sector as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.daq}. The hardware and configuration did not allow triggering on two tracks in the same sector because there were only six signals coming from the \abbr{TOF} --- one for each sector. The coincidence of these tracks with the photon tagger, called the ``Master-\abbr{OR},'' is defined in Table~\ref{tab:data.trig.mor}.

There were two sets of thresholds for the \abbr{EC} labeled \emph{photon} and \emph{electron}. These labels did not mean photon or electron specifically, but were considered a first-order approximation. The actual particle identification was done much later in the analysis of the reconstructed data. The thresholds for the \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} during the \desg{g12} running period are shown in Table~\ref{tab:data.ecccthresh}.
