\subsection{\label{sec:summary.runs}Lists of Runs}

The runs for this experiment range from 56855 to 57317 inclusive. The runs that made it into Tables.~\ref{tab:data.cook.prodruns} and \ref{tab:data.cook.singlesecruns} qualified upon success of reconstructing final-state hadrons using the cooking program's default particle identification in coordination with the hand-written notes by the shift takers. Other runs of note include those used specifically for calibration in Table~\ref{tab:data.cook.org.runs} and normalization, zero-field and empty-target runs in Table~\ref{tab:data.calibruns}.

\input{tables/g12_prod_runs} % label:  tab:data.cook.prodruns

\input{tables/g12_single_sec_runs} % tab:data.cook.singlesecruns

\input{tables/g12_special_runs} % tab:data.calibruns

A script named ``g12runs'' was created to provide a list of the runs which were fully reconstructed without errors. It can also provide a lot of information about each run including the beam current, the number of good scalar intervals, and the run type such as production, calibration, or single-sector. The script resides in the \emph{clasg12} user's home directory here:
\begin{align}
    \texttt{/home/clasg12/local/scripts/g12runs} \nonumber
\end{align}
and has an extensive help message with the ``-h'' as shown here:

\begin{verbatim}
>/home/clasg12/local/scripts/g12runs -h
Usage:     usage: g12runs [options]

    example to get all good data runs:
        g12runs -t prod -t single -x calib

    to get all data runs (prod and single) that have
    been completely cooked, sorted and have complete
    flux information:
        g12runs -t pass1 -t flux -i

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r RANGE, --range=RANGE
                        range of runs to print out (inclusive from:to) To get
                        the six-digit run numbers, use this range:
                        557313:557316. Can also be a single run number.
                        default: 56363:557316
  -c CURRENT, --current=CURRENT
                        range of currents to print out (inclusive from:to).
                        examples: 40:80, 20:35 default: 0:90
  -t RUNTYPE, --run-type=RUNTYPE
                        Type of runs to print out. can be any of the
                        following, and may be specified more than once: prod
                        single calib cc dc norm pass1 flux Note: calib
                        includes all norm runs. Use prod, single and calib to
                        get all runs. default: prod, single
  -x EXCLUDE, --exclude-type=EXCLUDE
                        excludes types from being printed out. may be
                        specified more than once.
  -i, --intersect       require all run types specified with the -t option to
                        be valid. Note: "g12runs -tprod -tsingle -i" will
                        result in no output since prod and single run types
                        are mutualy exclusive. Typical usage is to get runs
                        that have complete pass1 and flux data: "g12runs
                        -tpass1 -tflux -i".
  -e, --extra-info      print extra information for each run.
  -m, --max-ind         print maximum index for each run printed.
  -n, --nfiles          print number of files for each run printed.
  -s SET, --set=SET     print runs which correspond to one (or all by default)
                        of ten groups: 1 - 10. These groups represent
                        approximately 10% of the whole run period.
  -a, --scalar          Print out the number of scalar intervals in the form:
                        good/total.
  -d, --dump            Dump all info about all runs.
