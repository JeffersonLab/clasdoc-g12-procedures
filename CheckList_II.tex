\title{G12 Analysis Checklist}
\date{\vspace{-10ex}}
\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	The following procedures are common for most g12 analyses and have been approved by the g12 procedure review committee in the g12 analysis procedures manuscript~\cite{g12note}.
	By checking the ''yes`` boxes below, I hereby confirm that I understood and applied the procedures in accordance with the g12 analysis note. I also understand that if a procedure in the analysis is not done in accordance with the g12 analysis procedures, the box ''no`` should be checked and a separate analysis note on the procedure is required. If a procedure in the g12 analysis note is not applicable, to the analysis, the box ''N/A`` should be checked.
