\section{\label{sec:calib}Calibration and Detector Performance}

The calibration of the raw data was done through seven incomplete but representative passes labeled \verb+pass0_v1+ through \verb+pass0_v7+ though only the last three of these is still available via JLab's mass storage system (\abbr{mss}). All calibration constants were put into the \mbox{\texttt{calib\_user.RunIndexg12}} run index with the exception of certain lepton-specific numbers as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:data.lepton}.
