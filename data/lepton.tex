\subsection{\label{sec:data.lepton}General Features of Lepton Data in \desg{g12}}

To identify electrons and positrons properly in \abbr{CLAS}, quantities obtained from the \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} are used to reject charged pions. The \abbr{CC} collects the number of photo-electrons caused by Cerenkov radiation and the \abbr{EC} records the energy deposition of electrons/positrons as well as photons. A previous \abbr{CLAS} experiment \desg{g7} analyzed the properties of medium modifications from the decay of vector mesons through the lepton decay channel. This experiment derived a set of cits for identifying electron/positrons pairs in \abbr{CLAS} by employing specific cuts to the number of photo-electrons (\abbr{NPE}) detected in the \abbr{CC}, a match in azimuthal angle $\phi$ from a charged track in the \abbr{DC} to the $\phi$ of the \abbr{CC}, as well as comparing the momentum of the charged track to the energy deposited in the \abbr{EC}. These cuts can be found in Table~\ref{tab:ISLEP_cuts}.
\input{tables/islep.tex}
To validate the \desg{g7} electron/positron \abbr{PID} scheme for \desg{g12}, a comparison of  the \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} quantities was performed for all charged tracks \abbr{CC}/\abbr{EC} hit signatures and while selecting events from π$^0$ decay. To separate the π$^0$ events from the π$^+$π$^-$ events, all charged pions were assigned the mass of electrons and cuts were placed on the missing energy of \mbox{γ p$\rightarrow$p e$^+$ e$^-$} as well as a cut on the missing mass squared of \mbox{γ p$\rightarrow$ p}, values found in Table~\ref{tab:lep_cuts}. A graphical depiction of the cuts applied to separate π$^0$ events from the π$^+$π$^-$ events is seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:islep.cuts}.
\input{tables/lepPIDcuts.tex}
The values of the threshold momentum are calculated from empirical studies and are based upon calculations using the momentum obtained from the \abbr{DC}$p$ under the following criteria;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{p_{thres}^{low}} = \alpha p *(p+EC_{P\_LO})/p \nonumber \\
\mathrm{p_{thres}^{high}} = \alpha p *(p+EC_{P\_HIGH})/p \nonumber
\end{align}
where $EC_{P\_LO} = -0.3$, $EC_{P\_HIGH} = 0.5$ and
\begin{align}
\alpha p =
\begin{cases}
.23*p + .071p^2 - .032p^3, & p<1.0 \text{~GeV} \\
0.272p, & p>1.0 \text{~GeV} \\
\end{cases}\nonumber
\end{align}

\begin{v2}
There are more and more restrictive cuts one can always do to try to clean up a lepton signal, but the general \abbr{CC}, \abbr{TOF}, and \abbr{EC}$_\mathrm{total}$ are the most robust. After that you can make further cuts on \abbr{EC}$_\mathrm{inner}$ and/or \abbr{EC}$_\mathrm{outer}$ at the users discretion. The g7 lepton cuts were the standard isLepton(), plus a $>45$~MeC \abbr{EC}$_\mathrm{inner}$ cut, see Ref.~\ref{clas.nasseripour}.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:data.lepton.cc}\abbr{CC} Comparison}

The \abbr{NPE} measured by the \abbr{CC} for all positron/electron (e$^+$/e$^-$) candidates can be seen in Fig~\ref{fig:islep.CC}. The sharp decline prior to 2.5 \abbr{NPE} is due to photo-electrons created by electron/positrons, pions traveling through the \abbr{CC} or pions producing delta-electrons which pass through the \abbr{CC}. Delta-electrons are created as an effect of the ionization of gases that could be present when the pion travels through the \abbr{DC}. These types of electrons are typically lower in momentum than the electrons obtained from particle decays in \abbr{CLAS} and thus should emit less \abbr{NPE} per unit length.

Through mass conservation the particles for the π$^0$ events must be e$^+$/e$^-$ pairs. In comparison to fig.~\ref{fig:islep.CC}, fig.~\ref{fig:islep.CC1} plots the \abbr{NPE} measured by the \abbr{CC} for all e$^+$/e$^-$ pairs for π$^0$ events selected as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:islep.cuts}. It can be seen that the sharp decline prior to \abbr{NPE} = 2.5 is reduced leaving mostly electrons or positrons signatures in the \abbr{CC} concluding that the \desg{g7} \abbr{CC} \abbr{NPE} cut is valid for identifying e$^+$/e$^-$ pairs while rejecting π$^+$/π$^-$ pairs.

\begin{v2}Using the current cuts of \abbr{NPE} and hit angle, the suppression of di-leptons was sufficient without including additional cuts on the \abbr{CC} such as a timing comparison to the \abbr{TOF}. This method of lepton \abbr{PID}, involving di-leptons, was established during the \textit{g7} run period. Further \textit{g12} analyses that involve single lepton \abbr{PID} could include this as a cut.\end{v2}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:data.lepton.ec}\abbr{EC} Comparison}

Similarly to the \abbr{CC} comparison, figures~\ref{fig:islep.pimEClow},~\ref{fig:islep.pimEChigh},~\ref{fig:islep.pipEClow},~\ref{fig:islep.pipEChigh} depict the  p$\mathrm{_{thres}^{low}}$ and  p$\mathrm{_{thres}^{low}}$ cuts listed in  Table~\ref{tab:ISLEP_cuts} for the q$^-$ and q$^+$ tracks respectively. After π$^0$ event selection, seen in figures~\ref{fig:islep.pimEC},~\ref{fig:islep.pimECcut} ,~\ref{fig:islep.pipEC} ,~\ref{fig:islep.pipECcut}, the bulk of e$^+$/e$^-$ events reside within the region of the cut acceptance therefore it is evident that the \desg{g7} \abbr{EC} cuts are valid for identifying e$^+$/e$^-$ pairs. The following four plots are for electron($e^-$) \abbr{PID} validation of the \desg{g7} \abbr{EC} cuts described in Table~\ref{tab:ISLEP_cuts}.
